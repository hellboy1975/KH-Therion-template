Kelly Hill Therion template.  This is a boilerplate repo designed to help those learning to use Therion for the
Kelly Hill Cave Project.  It is configured in a manner that should render the caves using the ASF Cave Map symbols,
with a few UIS ones used occasionally because it looks a little nicer.

This repo is a work in progress, so expect changes.  Feel free to suggest changes too!

## How to use
This is pre-configured to use the sample cave k90.  The following instructions should build a map

1. Install Therion https://therion.speleo.sk - see also "Setting up Therion"
2. Open COMPILE.thconfig using xTherion
3. Create a directory called `output`
4. click the Compile button
5. check in the `output` folder for PDFs for the example cave

## Setting up Therion

Depending on your operating system you have a few options:

1. Download the installer to install Windows [https://therion.speleo.sk/download.php]
2. Install via your Linux package manager
    1. For Ubuntu `sudo apt install therion`

Note: the package manager appears to be either out of date (Ubuntu), or not working at all (Fedora) in my experience.  For the brave, [Github](https://github.com/therion/therion) allows you to clone and build the code yourself.

**Alternative**: For linux users struggling somewhat, Therion works well under [WINE](https://www.winehq.org/).
